\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Obscuring Access Patterns}

Is there a cost-effective way to obfuscate traffic patterns on the
cloud? Can we model the minimum cost necessary to ensure obfuscated
access patterns for cloud data?

\subsection{False Bottom and Deniable Encryption}
Implementing features that enable users to be able to declare false
bottoms to their data storage.

\subsection{Cryptographic advances aka Hair-brained ideas}

Delta encodable block cipher.
