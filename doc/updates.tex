\section{How to Update a File}

When files are small, recording a version update by uploading the
entire file is an inexpensive proposition. A 4KB file would have to be
updated every 10 seconds for a month to accrue the cost of uploading 1
GB of data.

When uploading a large file, while probably not every 10 seconds, the
cost could become substantial if the actual byte value difference of
the versions of the file are small. In other words, it makes sense to
use delta encoding in order to managed file deltas.

Our delta enoding scheme follows the same algorithm as
rsync~\cite{rsync}. 

File change workloads for different delta encoding algorithms. Changes
across powerpoint files, music files, videos.

How long does it take to generate checksums for a file?
