\begin{abstract}

Users want to share data over the Internet but do so without shifting
their mental models for how data should be. Safe Deposit Box (SDB) is
a built-from-scratch, privacy/security-aware alternative to popular
file sync, sharing, and versioning systems like Dropbox. SDB operates
as a user program in the background, synchronizing contents from
user-specified directories to a cloud service. Data is encrypted in
transit to and in storage on the cloud storage service providerâ€™s
(SSP) servers. SDB also enables users to share encrypted data with
friends who use the SDB program. We show how sharing can be efficient,
correct, and, most importantly, intuitive for everyday users. We
present the full design and implementation of SDB using Amazon Web
Services Simple Storage Service~\cite{s3} and
SimpleDB~\cite{simpledb}. SDB makes secure file sharing private and
always available.
