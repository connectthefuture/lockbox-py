\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Microbenchmarks}

\note{benchmark individual pieces of the system. In particular, do we

\subsection{Blocksizes}

\note{Perhaps we should choose a variable blocksize based on the size
  of the checkpointed file?}

\subsection{Crypto Bakeoff}

\subsection{User Experience}
