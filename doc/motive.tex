\section{Motivation}

Cloud services are common: Gmail, Hotmail, Facebook. Website startups leverage
web services from companies like Amazon~\cite{aws}.

User security for data could be compromised.

The goal: Serve the everyday small groups who want to collaborate and
know that their data privacy will not be compromised. The only data is
leaked is if one of the trusted users passes the data through a
non-SDB channel.

No great everyday solution. Why? No benefit to the companies?

Convenience is an important value. Dropbox is a great example of
taking this value to heart. 

But the Dropbox privacy policy is frustrating.

How can everyday users protect their data easily without having to
trust the cloud with their data in cleartext?

Not only does a single SDB directory make intuitive sense in a user's
mental model for file management and sharing, but this familiar
interface also limits the risk of a user unwittingly copying the file
elsewhere and compromising security.
