\section{How to Share a File}

In our hybrid cryptosystem, the challenge for sharing files rests in
managing keys correctly and efficiently. We consider three designs in
our discussion.

Recall that our hybrid cryptosystem takes advantage of the ability of
block ciphers (i.e., AES-256) to cipher efficiently any file with a
password while public key cryptography (i.e., RSA) enables us to
control access to the file password.

\subsection{Everytime, A New Password}

When a user updates a file we can generate a new block cipher
password, encrypt this password with all of the file friends' public
keys, and upload the generated files to the cloud.

\subsection{Hash Chains}

\note{maybe...}

\subsection{Mix with Deltas and Stir}

We encrypt the deltas. But happens when we revoke access or grant new
access to a file? Or, worse, revoke access then regrant a few versions
later?
